## Application Description
I created this project as an assignment but quickly made it my own. This website is my own personal portfolio. It has a short bio, a portfolio page that will soon be filled with many projects and assignments. And a contact page.
 
I created the website to function and look the way it does because it has my own personal style with the white and gray color scheme with the mountains as the background. I was able to create this web application using react, CSS, Bootstrap and bootswatch. Now that I have built this portfolio I have a place to display my work and look more professional to future employers.
